The project aim was to learn ethical hacking in the period of two months in Summer 2016. The initial idea was to learn basics of systems and later go about solving Capture the Flags, but we ended up doing both simaltaneously. 

The only snags we hit were that one must be well introduced to `Python`, `Ruby`, `Perl`, `PHP` and `SQL` and had to learn them before we could make some major headway. Another basic thing we lagged in was knowledge of `Architecture` while trying to work with hacking binaries.

There are the 3 kinds of hacking broadly:

1. Binaries
2. Web
3. System or Servers 

Resources we were using are as follows:

1. [Natas](https://natas.overthewire.org)
2. [Bandit](https://bandit.overthewire.org)
3. [Security Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-security/home/welcome)
4. [Hack this Site](https://www.hackthissite.org/)
